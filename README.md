# Data Model

## Entity: User

These properties cannot be set by the user. They are either automatically generated by the Google Datastore or derived from the user&#39;s Google Account.

| **Property** | **Type** | **Valid Values** | **Description** | **Required?** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| id | String | Arabic numerals 0-9, 16 in length | Generated by Google Datastore upon creation of user. | Yes |
| user\_id | String | Arabic numerals 0-9, less than 23 in length | Generated from the JSON Web Token &#39;sub&#39; field upon creation of a new account when user is authenticated through Google OAuth 2.0 API. | Yes |

###

## Entity: Pet

The first three properties listed are the inherent properties to a Pet Entity. These are the properties under control when creating or updating a Pet Entity. Pet Entities can be created or updated without specifying values for these properties, but they really should be given values otherwise their value will be null.

| **Property** | **Type** | **Valid Values** | **Description** | **Required?** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| species | String | English letters and spaces, a-z or A-Z, less than 20 in length | The kind of animal that the pet is. | Not enforced, but strongly recommended |
| color | String | English letters and spaces, a-z or A-Z, less than 20 in length | The color of the animal that is used for identification purposes. | Not enforced, but strongly recommended |
| name | String | English letters and spaces, a-z or A-Z, less than 20 in length | What the pet is called by the owner. | Not enforced, but strongly recommended |

The next three properties listed are automatically created when the Pet Entity is created.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| owner (relationship) | String | Arabic numerals 0-9, less than 23 in length | The user\_id of the pet&#39;s owner | Yes |
| room (relationship) | Object | JSON object attributes-begins empty on creation-once pet is assigned to room, &quot;id&quot; of room and &quot;name&quot; of room are stored in the object | Description of the room that the pet is currently in. | Yes |
| id | String | Arabic numerals 0-9, 16 in length | Generated by Google Datastore upon creation of user. | Yes |

## Entity: Room

The first four properties listed are the inherent properties to a Room Entity. These are the properties under control when creating or updating a Room Entity. Room Entities can be created or updated without specifying values for these properties, but they really should be given values otherwise their value will be null.

| **Name** | **Type** | **Valid Values** | **Description** | **Required?** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| type | String | English letters and spaces, a-z or A-Z, less than 20 in length | The kind of room. | Not enforced, but strongly recommended |
| name | String | English letters and spaces, a-z or A-Z, less than 20 in length | What the room is called. | Not enforced, but strongly recommended |
| size | Number | Arabic numerals 0-9, up to 999 | The area of the room in square feet. | Not enforced, but strongly recommended |
| rate | Number (decimal) | Arabic numerals 0-9 and radix, up to 99.99 | The price of the room per night | Not enforced, but strongly recommended |

The next two properties listed are automatically created when a Room Entity is created.

| **Property** | **Type** | **Valid Values** | **Description** | **Required?** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| id | String | Arabic numerals 0-9, 16 in length | Generated by Google Datastore upon creation of user. | Yes |

## Relationship Summary

Figure 1 shows a simple ERD that summaries the relationships among the three entities.

Users can own 0 to many pets. Pets can have only one owner.

Pets can reside in 0 or only one room. A room can hold 0 to many pets.

![](RackMultipart20200611-4-tgzhne_html_9b351a812c23f976.png) Figure 1. ERD showing entities, their properties, and relationships.

## Relationship Rules

1) Pets are protected and can only be created, read, updated, or deleted by their authenticated owner.

2) Rooms are unprotected. They can be created, read, updated, or deleted by non-authenticated users.

3) Rooms can only be deleted if no pets are in them.

4) Pets can only reside in rooms with pets of the same owner, and the number of pets placed in the same room is not limited.

5) Relationship properties cannot be changed through PATCH and PUT update operations on room in order to protect the pet relationships.

# Update a Pet Via PATCH

Allows for updating a pet&#39;s attributes with the HTTP Verb &#39;PATCH&#39;

All JSON stored attributes of the pet entity remain the same unless specifically specified in request body.

Disclaimer: This route not intended for managing pet-room assignments. Pet-room assignments can only be managed through: DELETE /room/:room\_id/pets/:pet\_id or PUT /room/:room\_id/pets/:pet\_id Only attributes inherit to the pet entity will be affected.

Rather than having a 403 for the user if they are forbidden from accessing the pet, the 404 leaves it ambiguous as to whether they have stumbled upon another user&#39;s pet&#39;s id. This is used in other API&#39;s such as GitHub to further protect privacy. |

# Delete a Pet

Allows for deleting a pet from the system. If the pet is currently in a room, the pet will be removed from that room.

| DELETE /pets/:pet\_id |
| --- |

## Request

### Request Parameters

| **Name** | **Type** | **Description** | **Required?** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| pet\_id | String | ID of the pet | Yes |

### Request Body

None

### Authorization

&quot;Authorization&quot; header required. Type &quot;Bearer&quot;. Token format: JSON Web Token (JWT).

## Response

No body

### Response Body Format

Success: No body

Failure: JSON

### Response Statuses

| **Outcome** | **Status Code** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Success | 204 No Content |
 |
| Failure | 404 Not Found | If the pet is not found in the set of pets that the user owns or if the user tries delete a pet that they do not own, then the 404 error is produced. It is possible that a 403 could have been used for the later case, but the 404 seems appropriate because it is also a way to protect the privacy of the other user in not allowing the other users to know the id of pets that they do not own. It is also borderline an appropriate case because the combination of the user&#39;s id and pet id do not exist. |

### Response Examples

- Removal of the pet from the datastore also updates the occupants attribute for the room that the pet was assigned to by removing pet&#39;s id from the array of occupants.

#### Success

| Status: 204 No Content |
| --- |

#### Failure

| Status: 404 Not Found
{ &quot;Error&quot;: &quot;No pet with this pet id exists for current user.&quot; } |
| --- |

# Remove a Pet From a Room

| DELETE /rooms/:room\_id/pets/:pet\_id |
| --- |

## Request

### Request Parameters

| **Name** | **Type** | **Description** | **Required?** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| room\_id | String | ID of the room | Yes |
| pet\_id | String | ID of the pet | Yes |

### Request Body

None

Note: Set Content-Length to 0 in your request when calling out to this endpoint.

## Response

No body

## Authorization

Authorization&quot; header required. Type &quot;Bearer&quot;. Token format: JSON Web Token (JWT).

### Response Body Format

Success: No body

Failure: JSON

### Response Statuses

| **Outcome** | **Status Code** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Success | 204 No Content | Succeeds only if a room exists with this room\_id and the specified pet owned by the user is in that room. |
| Failure | 404 Not Found | No room with that room id exists. |
| Failure | 404 Not Found | No pet with that pet\_id exists under the current user&#39;s ownership. Again, a 404 here protects the pet\_id leaving it ambiguous as to whether a pet with that id exists. The actual owner would know it does. A 403 would let a non-owner know a pet&#39;s id number and what room it is in. |
| Failure | 401 Unauthorized | The user was not authenticated and not recognized by the server. |

#### Success

| Status: 204 No Content |

| --- |
| Status: 404 Not Found

#### Failure

| Status: 401 Unauthorized
{ &quot;Error&quot;: &quot;Invalid token signature.&quot; } |
